# General Information 
The purpose of this project is to train an image classifier to assign the right recycling bin category to garbage waste! Waste generation has massively increased around the world in recent decades, and unfortunately there are no signs of it slowing down. The goal of this project is to support fast, efficient, and correct decision-making processes when recycling, so that we can address the increasing waste generation. We undertook this project as part of a Tech Festival where we could showcase our technical skills.

# Setup
To set up the project, a new environment must be created. It can be created with the command 'conda activate <name_of_the_project>. This will help make sure that Torch can be used.
